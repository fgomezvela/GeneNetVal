# GeneNetCoherence: Gene Network Coherence based on interaction relevance 

================================

This is a Java application for network analysis. The application uses 
the metabolic pathways stored in kegg to rate the coherence of an input network.


The code is on http://fgomezvela.github.com/GeneNetCoherence/.

=================================

This application can be used in linux, mac, and windows.
To use this tool, you must first download the GeneNetCoherence.zip file.

In ExampleData folder there are some gene networks for testing the tool.



Usage information
==================================

> java -jar GeneNetCoherence.jar inputFile organismId accuracyLevel outPutFile [classical]
* Usage: java -jar GeneNetCoherence.jar Nariai et al. (2004).txt sce 3 results.txt



ARGUMENTS:

inputFile:
	-- Notice: The tool uses the relative path from the root
	-- Specification:
				geneA;geneB
				geneC;geneD
				...

organismId:
	-- Denotes the organism prefix. See: http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/catalog/org_list.html
	-- Example: 
		    prefix: hsa    	organism: Homo sapiens (human)
		    prefix: sce    	organism: Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast)
		    ...	

accuracyLevel:
	-- The threshold for the accuracy level of the methodology.
	-- This argument indicates the maximun level to calculate the Hits
	-- The accuracy level must be a value greater than 1.

outputFile:
	-- The path to the result file.
	-- Specification:
				
		PathwayId : Pathway identifier
		Pathway Description : Pathway functional description	 
		Hits level i : Number of Hits with the accuracy level i 
		Cumulative Hits level n : The value of Cumulative Hits level n	 
		Cumulative Faliures level n : The value of Cumulative Hits level n		
		Network Coherence level n: The value of the input network coherence with the pathway (level n).
				


classical:(optional)
	-- If you want to use the "classical use of KEGG".
	-- With this option, the pathways will not be transformed into a gene network.  
	-- Example: java -jar GeneNetCoherence.jar Nariai et al. (2004).txt sce 3 results.txt classical


Example Data
==================================
In the example data folder, there are stored four  well-known yeast networks. Network specification:

	-- Nariai et al. (2004).txt: This network represents the Saccharomyces cerevisae (SCE) cell cycle
			       	    and it is composed of 47 relationships between 43 yeast genes. 
				    The network is a reconstruction of the cell cylce from time–series microarray 
				    data refined using PPI data (Spellman et al., 1998).
	-- Batada et al. (2006).txt: The network presented by Batada et al. (2006) where a PPI network is presented
				     in the study of the highly connected proteins in a network (hubs).
	-- Cherry et al.(2011)(SGD).txt: This network that provides an access to the complete Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic sequence. 
					In this study, only the PPI + PDI (protein–DNA interaction) data available were taken. 
	-- Lee et al. (2007)(YeastNet v.2).txt: Lee et al. (2007)(YeastNet v.2) which combines PPI, PDI, coexpression, phy- logenetic 
						conservation and literature information.
